# FreeBIRD

Open Source executable transformations and test data built upon the ECB BIRD data model - https://bird.ecb.europa.eu/

To run from the Github webpage, just start a code space and type the following in the terminal.

sh ./code_space_startup.sh

This will also run all the tests and make the test results availabe from the web application in the test results report  screen.

If you want to run a very sepecific test scenario, and keep just the data for that scenario loaded in the database, then edit and run code_space_startup_anacredit_case1_scenario.sh instead. If not edited, that script will load in data for anacredit test case 2 from Anacredit manual part 3 section 8.3

The transformation logic is created with Eclipse Free BIRD Tools : https://github.com/eclipse-efbt/efbt

A 5 minute demo is available in https://youtu.be/jejDGgnVLkM
