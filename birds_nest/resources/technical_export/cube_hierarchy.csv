SDD_ENTITY,ECB,Entity,ENTITY,"This endpoint enables you to retrieve the information about an entity and its structure. An Entity is the metadata definition of a certain table, template. In the SMCube methodology this corresponds to a Cube.",ERM,SDD
SDD_PACKAGES,ECB,SDD packages,SDD_PACKAGES,,ERM,SDD
SDD_ATTRIBUTE,ECB,Attribute,ATTRIBUTE,The information collected for this endpoint can be used to retrieve information about an attribute (which can be an attribute of an Entity) and its whole set of values. In the SMCube methodology this is defined as a Variable.,ERM,SDD
SDD_DATA_MODEL,ECB,Data model,DATA_MODEL,This endpoint enables you to retrieve all the most relevant information about a data model. A data model is composed of entities organised in a hierarchical structure; such structure can reflect the business logic of data and its relationship. The API retuens such hierarchical structure organised in nodes. It also returns the relationships between the entities of the data model. In the SMCube methodology this is defined by a Cube Hierarchy object.,ERM,SDD
SDD_VALUE_COMBINATION,ECB,Value combination,VALUE_COMBINATION,This endpoint enables you to retrieve the information about a combination of values an entity can assume. This corresponds to either a data point or a series key. In the SMCube methodology this is defined as a Combination object.,ERM,SDD
SDD_ATTRIBUTE_RELATED_ENTITY,ECB,Attribute related entity,ATTRIBUTE_RELATED_ENTITY,This endpoint enables you to retrieve all the Entities which include a certain variable/attribute as part of its structure definition. The user should include the code(s) or ids of the attribute/variables to get the related entities. Passing no code or ids will return all the available entities.,ERM,SDD
