...
3. ‘Linked enterprises’ are enterprises which have any of the following relationships with each other:
(a) an enterprise has a majority of the shareholders' or members' voting rights in another enterprise;
(b) an enterprise has the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of another enterprise;
(c) an enterprise has the right to exercise a dominant influence over another enterprise pursuant to a contract entered
into with that enterprise or to a provision in its memorandum or articles of association;
(d) an enterprise, which is a shareholder in or member of another enterprise, controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders in or members of that enterprise, a majority of shareholders' or members' voting rights in that enterprise.
There is a presumption that no dominant influence exists if the investors listed in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 are not involving themselves directly or indirectly in the management of the enterprise in question, without prejudice to their rights as stakeholders.
Enterprises having any of the relationships described in the first subparagraph through one or more other enterprises, or any one of the investors mentioned in paragraph 2, are also considered to be linked.
Enterprises which have one or other of such relationships through a natural person or group of natural persons acting jointly are also considered linked enterprises if they engage in their activity or in part of their activity in the same relevant market or in adjacent markets.
An ‘adjacent market’ is considered to be the market for a product or service situated directly upstream or downstream of the relevant market.",2023-07-01,9999-12-31,1

This is subject to the provision that the CCP is based and prudentially supervised in a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator/overseer has established, and publicly indicated that it applies to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations that are consistent with the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. 
As is the case more generally, banking supervisors still reserve the right to require banks in their jurisdictions to hold additional capital against their exposures to such CCPs via Pillar 2. This might be appropriate where, for example, an external assessment such as an FSAP has found material shortcomings in the CCP or the regulation of CCPs, and the CCP and/or the CCP regulator have not since publicly addressed the issues identified.

ECB,BIRD_QCCP_LDM_1,Qualifying central counterparty (QCCP),BIRD_QCCP_LDM,"Basel Committee on Banking Supervision - Capital requirements for banks exposures to central counterparties (see https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs227.pdf): A qualifying central counterparty (QCCP) is an entity that is licensed to operate as a CCP (including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption), and is permitted by the appropriate regulator/overseer to operate as such with respect to the products offered. This is subject to the provision that the CCP is based and prudentially supervised in a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator/overseer has established, and publicly indicated that it applies to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations that are consistent with the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. 
As is the case more generally, banking supervisors still reserve the right to require banks in their jurisdictions to hold additional capital against their exposures to such CCPs via Pillar 2. This might be appropriate where, for example, an external assessment such as an FSAP has found material shortcomings in the CCP or the regulation of CCPs, and the CCP and/or the CCP regulator have not since publicly addressed the issues identified.

Definition: the deposit-taking corporations except the central bank subsector (S.122) includes all financial corporations and quasi-corporations, except those classified in the central bank and in the MMF subsectors, which are principally engaged in financial intermediation and whose business is to receive deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from institutional units, hence not only from MFIs, and, for their own account, to grant loans and/or to make investments in securities. 
2.76 Deposit-taking corporations except the central bank cannot be described simply as 'banks', because they may include some financial corporations which do not call themselves banks, or some financial corporations which are not permitted to do so in some countries, while some other financial corporations describing themselves as banks may not in fact be deposit-taking corporations. The following financial intermediaries are classified in sub- sector S.122: 
(a) commercial banks, 'universal' banks, 'all-purpose' banks; 
(b) savings banks (including trustee savings banks and savings banks and loan associations); 
(c) post office giro institutions, post banks, giro banks; 
(d) rural credit banks, agricultural credit banks; 
(e) cooperative credit banks, credit unions;

2.76 Deposit-taking corporations except the central bank cannot be described simply as 'banks', because they may include some financial corporations which do not call themselves banks, or some financial corporations which are not permitted to do so in some countries, while some other financial corporations describing themselves as banks may not in fact be deposit-taking corporations. The following financial intermediaries are classified in sub- sector S.122: 
(a) commercial banks, 'universal' banks, 'all-purpose' banks; 
(b) savings banks (including trustee savings banks and savings banks and loan associations);

Delta FX: the FX delta risk factors are defined below.

(a)	
The FX delta risk factors are all the exchange rates between the currency in which an instrument is denominated and the reporting currency. For transactions that reference an exchange rate between a pair of non-reporting currencies, the FX delta risk factors are all the exchange rates between:

(i)	
the reporting currency; and

(ii)	
both the currency in which an instrument is denominated and any other currencies referenced by the instrument.7

(b)	
Subject to supervisory approval, FX risk may alternatively be calculated relative to a base currency instead of the reporting currency. In such case the bank must account for not only:

(i)	
the FX risk against the base currency; but also

(ii)	
the FX risk between the reporting currency and the base currency (ie translation risk).

(c)	
The resulting FX risk calculated relative to the base currency as set out in (b) is converted to the capital requirements in the reporting currency using the spot reporting/base exchange rate reflecting the FX risk between the base currency and the reporting currency.

(d)	
The FX base currency approach may be allowed under the following conditions:

(i)	
To use this alternative, a bank may only consider a single currency as its base currency; and

(ii)	
The bank shall demonstrate to the relevant supervisor that calculating FX risk relative to their proposed base currency provides an appropriate risk representation for their portfolio (for example, by demonstrating that it does not inappropriately reduce capital requirements relative to those that would be calculated without the base currency approach) and that the translation risk between the base currency and the reporting currency is taken into account.

(2)	
Vega FX: the FX vega risk factors are the implied volatilities of options that reference exchange rates between currency pairs; as defined along one dimension, the maturity of the option. This is defined as the implied volatility of the option as mapped to one or several of the following maturity tenors: 0.5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years.

(3)	
Curvature FX: the FX curvature risk factors are defined below.

(a)	
The FX curvature risk factors are all the exchange rates between the currency in which an instrument is denominated and the reporting currency. For transactions that reference an exchange rate between a pair of non-reporting currencies, the FX risk factors are all the exchange rates between:

(i)	
the reporting currency; and

(ii)	
both the currency in which an instrument is denominated and any other currencies referenced by the instrument.

(b)	
Where supervisory approval for the base currency approach has been granted for delta risks, FX curvature risks shall also be calculated relative to a base currency instead of the reporting currency, and then converted to the capital requirements in the reporting currency using the spot reporting/base exchange rate.
