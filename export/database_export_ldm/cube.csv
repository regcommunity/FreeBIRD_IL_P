Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC, Annex, Title I Definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises adopted by the commission, Article 3 Types of enterprise taken into consideration in calculating staff numbers and financial amounts:
...
3. ‘Linked enterprises’ are enterprises which have any of the following relationships with each other:
(a) an enterprise has a majority of the shareholders' or members' voting rights in another enterprise;
(b) an enterprise has the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of another enterprise;
(c) an enterprise has the right to exercise a dominant influence over another enterprise pursuant to a contract entered
into with that enterprise or to a provision in its memorandum or articles of association;
(d) an enterprise, which is a shareholder in or member of another enterprise, controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders in or members of that enterprise, a majority of shareholders' or members' voting rights in that enterprise.
There is a presumption that no dominant influence exists if the investors listed in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 are not involving themselves directly or indirectly in the management of the enterprise in question, without prejudice to their rights as stakeholders.
Enterprises having any of the relationships described in the first subparagraph through one or more other enterprises, or any one of the investors mentioned in paragraph 2, are also considered to be linked.
Enterprises which have one or other of such relationships through a natural person or group of natural persons acting jointly are also considered linked enterprises if they engage in their activity or in part of their activity in the same relevant market or in adjacent markets.
An ‘adjacent market’ is considered to be the market for a product or service situated directly upstream or downstream of the relevant market.",true,,,

Delta FX: the FX delta risk factors are defined below.

(a)	
The FX delta risk factors are all the exchange rates between the currency in which an instrument is denominated and the reporting currency. For transactions that reference an exchange rate between a pair of non-reporting currencies, the FX delta risk factors are all the exchange rates between:

(i)	
the reporting currency; and

(ii)	
both the currency in which an instrument is denominated and any other currencies referenced by the instrument.7

(b)	
Subject to supervisory approval, FX risk may alternatively be calculated relative to a base currency instead of the reporting currency. In such case the bank must account for not only:

(i)	
the FX risk against the base currency; but also

(ii)	
the FX risk between the reporting currency and the base currency (ie translation risk).

(c)	
The resulting FX risk calculated relative to the base currency as set out in (b) is converted to the capital requirements in the reporting currency using the spot reporting/base exchange rate reflecting the FX risk between the base currency and the reporting currency.

(d)	
The FX base currency approach may be allowed under the following conditions:

(i)	
To use this alternative, a bank may only consider a single currency as its base currency; and

(ii)	
The bank shall demonstrate to the relevant supervisor that calculating FX risk relative to their proposed base currency provides an appropriate risk representation for their portfolio (for example, by demonstrating that it does not inappropriately reduce capital requirements relative to those that would be calculated without the base currency approach) and that the translation risk between the base currency and the reporting currency is taken into account.

(2)	
Vega FX: the FX vega risk factors are the implied volatilities of options that reference exchange rates between currency pairs; as defined along one dimension, the maturity of the option. This is defined as the implied volatility of the option as mapped to one or several of the following maturity tenors: 0.5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years.

(3)	
Curvature FX: the FX curvature risk factors are defined below.

(a)	
The FX curvature risk factors are all the exchange rates between the currency in which an instrument is denominated and the reporting currency. For transactions that reference an exchange rate between a pair of non-reporting currencies, the FX risk factors are all the exchange rates between:

(i)	
the reporting currency; and

(ii)	
both the currency in which an instrument is denominated and any other currencies referenced by the instrument.

(b)	
Where supervisory approval for the base currency approach has been granted for delta risks, FX curvature risks shall also be calculated relative to a base currency instead of the reporting currency, and then converted to the capital requirements in the reporting currency using the spot reporting/base exchange rate.

Specifically, goodwill is recorded in a situation in which the purchase price is higher than the sum of the fair value of all identifiable tangible and intangible assets purchased in the acquisition and the liabilities assumed in the process. The value of a company’s brand name, solid customer base, good customer relations, good employee relations, and any patents or proprietary technology represent some examples of goodwill.",true,,,

KB per bucket is a term used in the standardised approach for market risk under FRTB. It is the risk capital requirement for a given bucket of risk factors within a risk class. It is computed as an aggregation of risk positions first at the bucket level, and then across buckets within a risk class defined for the sensitivities-based method.

A bucket is a set of risk factors that are grouped together by common characteristics (eg all tenors of interest rate curves for the same currency), as defined in MAR21.39 to MAR21.892. A risk position is the portion of the risk of an instrument that relates to a risk factor.
